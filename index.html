<p>Application for the position of Back-End Engineer.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,<br>
  As a motivated individual and a computer enthusiast I am extremely interested to work on all those cutting edge technologies mentioned in the job description. I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge. 
  <br>
  Currently working as an embedded software engineer where I am developing both firmware (in embedded C) and software (in C#). Before that I designed (using sketch) and developed Android App (Java) for my own start-up though my starting was in web development (html, CSS, JS, PHP, laravel, SQL). From the quest of knowing deeply about the bit operations inside the computer, computer clock, registers, interrupt vector table etc. I took a project where my task was to show the microcontroller register, RAM, ROM values in real time in a windows based software. It took me a while to understand and find out the exact technologies which I could use to read the register memory of a MCU and interface it with windows app and portray into a software. I know these are not the exact technologies you are looking for but you will be glad to know nowadays python is the language which I start using to develop a new system in my current work place.
  <br>
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.
</p>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Sourav Saha
